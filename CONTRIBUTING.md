## Issue tracker

Use the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Novicell/novicell-frontend/issues) to submit [bug reports](#bug-reports), [features requests](#feature-requests)
and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests).

## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `css` - Issues stemming from our compiled CSS or source Less files.
- `docs` - Issues for improving or updating our documentation.
- `feature` - New features should be added as `suggestion`. When discussed and assigned to a contributor, the label should be changed from `suggestion` to `feature`, and can then begin development.
- `gulp` - Issues with our Gulp setup, which is used to concatenate and compile source files, and more.
- `help wanted` - Issues we need help from the community to resolve.
- `js` - Issues stemming from our compiled or source JavaScript files.
- `suggestion` - Suggestions for a new feature to be added, or an existing one to be extended or modified. Issues with this label should not be started.
- `wontfix` - As the title says, issues that will not be fixed.
- `duplicate` - As the title says, issue is a duplicate of another issue. Please make sure to write a comment linking to the original issue.

For a complete look at our labels, see the [our labels page](https://github.com/Novicell/novicell-frontend/labels).

   Please name your branch with the issue id as part of the name, like `Fixing issue #44` or `Feature #44`.
